        <h1 style="color: rgb(24, 148, 210)"> What Does a Server Do? </h1>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)"> <br> <br> If you've been around anyone who works in tech, you've probably heard the word "server" 
            used a lot.<br> For someone who doesn't deal with computers every day, it can be a difficult word to understand. What is a server? How does it affect you?<br>
            Read on to learn what these products do and why they have an essential role in how we enjoy the internet every day.
            </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(164, 231, 246)"> What is a server? </h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">Is a software or hardware device that accepts and responds to requests made over a network.<br> The device that makes the request, and receives a response from the server, is called a client
            .<br> On the Internet, the term "server" commonly refers to the computer system that receives requests for a web files and sends those files to the client.
            </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(164, 231, 246)"> What are they used for? </h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">Servers manage network resources.<br>
             For example, a user may set up a server to control access to a network,<mark style="color: rgb(92, 207, 236)">send/receive e-mail</mark>, <mark style="color: rgb(92, 207, 236)">manage print jobs</mark>, or a <mark style="color: rgb(92, 207, 236)">website</mark>  .<br> 
             They are also proficient at performing intense calculations. Some servers are committed to a specific task,<br>
             often referred to as dedicated. However, many servers today are shared servers that take on the responsibility of e-mail, DNS, FTP,<br>
             and multiple websites in the case of a web server.
            </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(164, 231, 246)"> Why are servers always on? </h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">Because they are commonly used to deliver services that are constantly required, most servers are never turned off.<br>
                 Consequently, when servers fail, they can cause the network users and company many problems. <br>To alleviate these issues, servers are commonly set up to be fault tolerant.
            </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(164, 231, 246)"> how server is work? </h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">There are two behind-the-scene players that work as partners to get a website to show up on your screen properly: the browser and the web server.<br>
                When an internet searcher types in a URL, the browser divides the URL into three parts:
            </p>
            <pre style="color: rgb(72, 154, 181);font-size: 120%">
    - The hypertext transfer protocol: http
    - The server name: www.thewebsite.com
    - The file name: web-server.htm
            </pre>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">Each of these parts have a different responsibility when it comes to interacting with a web server.
            </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(217, 140, 17);font-size: 100%;"> 1. Hypertext Transfer Protocol </h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">The hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is the language browsers and web servers use to communicate.<br> A browser delivers an HTTP request to a web server, and the web server transfers the hypertext to the internet searcher’s browser.<br>
                When a server receives a request, it checks whether or not the requested URL matches an existing file.<br>
                If it does, it will speedily return the requested file. If the file does not exist, it will return an error page.
            </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(217, 140, 17);font-size: 100%"> 2. Domain Name System </h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">The next part of the equation is the Domain Name System (DNS), which translates easy-to-remember domain names to numerical IP addresses.<br>
                 When you type a domain name into a browser, your internet service provider views the DNS that is tied to the domain name,
                 translates it into a computer-friendly IP address,<br> and then directs your internet connection to the server, delivering up a set of stored files.<br> 
                 These stored files show up as a website.
            </p>
        <h2 style="color: rgb(217, 140, 17);font-size: 100%"> 3. File Name </h2>
            <p style="color: rgb(250, 250, 250)">
                The web server stores all of the data files related to each unique domain name. <br>
                This includes all the content, HTML documents, images, CSS stylesheets, videos, fonts, JavaScript files, and more — basically, 
                everything that converts into organized text, design, images, or videos when you see a website.And that’s it. <br>
                Now the next time you surf the web, you’ll know exactly what’s happening behind the curtain.<br>
