      <h3 style="color:brown"><i>Here's a brief about Roronoa Zoro :</i></h3>
      <div class="fa" style="font-family:Calibri">
      <p>
        He is one of the two swordsmen of the Straw Hat Pirates, the other being Brook. In the story, Zoro is the first to join Monkey D. Luffy after he is saved from being executed at the Marine Base. As a native to the East Blue, he came from the town known as Shimotsuki, where he trained in a dojo. He is an expert swordsman who uses three swords for his Santōryū (Three Sword Style), but is also capable of the one and two-sword styles(Ittoryu and Nitoryuu). He seems to be more comfortable and powerful using three swords, but he also uses one sword or two swords against weaker enemies. He usually keeps his Wado uIchimonji on his mouth when he performs santoryuu. Before fighting Ryuuma he used to use his Wado Ichimonji as his first choice for one sword style but after the fight and especially after the two-year timeskip, he uses the black sword Shusui as his first choice of his one sword style.</p>
